# E09a-Scripting

We learned how to add a score, lives, and game over screen triggered by hitting certain colored blocks, deleting the ball, and loosing all three balls. I was able to change the text font and size. I look forward to adding things like custom assets and different tile shapes. 
I am happy I was able to catch up!
 
I apologize that I was not able to add other cool features. I had a huge CS assignment and I was already behind and catching up tonight. I will definately go all out with this juicy breakout thought!!!
